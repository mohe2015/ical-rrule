You can use PGP encryption if you want.

You can import it using: `gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 0x1248D3E11D114A8575C989346794D45A488C2EDE`

You can expect me to respond within a few days but please be patient if it takes longer.

Please provide as much details as you can. If you have one a proof of concept would be great.

If you report a valid vulnerability you can get a place in the (currently nonexistent) Hall of Fame.
There may be a possibility for a bug bounty but I can't guarantee that.

You can write in English or German.
